LeaveWise – Smart Attendance & Leave Planning App

LeaveWise is a smart mobile application designed to help students plan and manage their attendance efficiently. The application allows students to upload their timetable, plan attendance for each lecture slot, and later mark actual attendance. The system compares planned and actual attendance and generates warnings if attendance falls below the minimum required percentage.
This project focuses on improving attendance planning, reducing shortage risks, and helping students make better academic decisions.
